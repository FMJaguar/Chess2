normal way:
* player inputs a move
* ui sends move to addTextMove
* addTextMove parses move and calls addMove for that move
* addMove calls necessary things, which moves the piece.
* everything returns True up the stack, passing off to UI
* UI prints success or failure depending

duel method:
* player inputs a move
* UI sends move to checkTextMove
* checkTextMove parses from and to locations
* if to location is empty, call addTextMove for that move
* if to location is occupied, call checkDuel
* checkDuel compares cost to stone pool, subtracts cost if available and returns boolean depending on success
* UI asks for bid amount from attacker, checks number of available stones and returns error if too much
* UI asks the same of the defender
* UI calls initiateDuel
* initiateDuel subtracts the stones from respective stone pools, returns winner
* if attacker: UI calls addTextMove
* if defender: UI calls addTextMove and clearLocation
* clearLocation sets the from location to "."
